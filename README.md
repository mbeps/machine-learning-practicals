# **6CCS3ML1 Machine Learning Practicals**

Welcome to the repository for the **6CCS3ML1 Machine Learning Practicals**. This repository contains practical exercises aimed at reinforcing key machine learning concepts through hands-on implementation. Each practical aligns with a specific lecture topic and involves using **Python** and **scikit-learn** to build and evaluate machine learning models.

## **Practical Topics**

### **Practical 1: Machine Learning Metrics**
- Evaluating machine learning models.
- Implementing and interpreting decision trees.
- Cross-validation techniques.
- Computing precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
- Applying k-nearest neighbour classification.

### **Practical 2: Regression and Gradient Descent**
- Implementing linear regression.
- Optimising models using gradient descent.
- Comparing stochastic and batch gradient descent.
- Extending models to multivariate regression.
- Evaluating models using mean squared error and variance score.

### **Practical 3: K-Means Clustering**
- Implementing the K-means clustering algorithm.
- Evaluating clustering performance using the Rand Index.
- Comparing custom implementations with optimised methods.
- Exploring K-means++ initialisation.
- Generalising clustering solutions for different numbers of clusters.


## 1. **Clone the Project Locally**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mbeps/machine-learning-practicals.git
```

## 2. **Set Up Environment**

### Using Anaconda (Preferred)
If you have Anaconda installed, create a new environment and activate it. Once active, install the required packages.

### Using Poetry (Alternative for non-Anaconda users)
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed.
2. If you are using Poetry and do not have Anaconda, install the dependencies:

```sh
poetry install
```

## 3. **Run the Project**
After setting up the environment and installing all dependencies, navigate to the project's root directory and run the main notebook. 

> Note: Adjust the specific steps, commands, or any other requirements based on the nature of your project or any additional configurations that might be needed.
